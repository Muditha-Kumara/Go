Assignment: Customizing and Extending the Go Backend for Intelligent Devices
Objective: This assignment challenges you to adapt the Go backend codebase for your
intelligent devices project. By implementing and customizing data entities, handlers,
validators, and database tables, you’ll create a backend that fits your specific project
requirements. This hands-on task will reinforce your skills in backend development and
data handling.
Instructions:
1. If needed: Familiarize Yourself with the Codebase
Review the provided Go backend codebase and understand the
key components, including routes, handlers, validators, and
database schemas.
Identify areas where customizations will be needed to align the
backend with your project’s intelligent device requirements.
2. Define Your Device Data Entity
Based on the data your device collects or interacts with, design a
custom data entity. This should include attributes specific to your
device’s functionality (e.g., temperature, humidity, or sensor status
for a smart thermostat).
3. Implement Custom Data Entity and Handlers
Extend/Update the codebase by adding your custom data entity to
the project, including the necessary database table(s) and struct(s).
Write/Modify handlers for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations for this entity, adapting any sample handlers provided
as necessary.
Ensure each handler follows RESTful conventions and handles any
edge cases (e.g., missing or incorrect data).
4. Set Up and Customize Validators
Implement custom validators for your entity to ensure data
integrity (e.g., range checks, required fields).
Integrate these validators into your CRUD handlers so that
validation occurs before database operations.
5. Integrate Your Device with the Backend

Connect your intelligent device(s) to the backend API. Your device
should send data to and retrieve data from the backend as
required by your project.
6. Advanced: Add Intelligence (Optional)
If your device performs intelligent functions (e.g., predictive
analysis, automation), add backend support for these functions.
7. Testing and Debugging
Rigorously test your customized backend and its integration with
the device.
8. Documentation and Reflection
Document your customization steps, including code explanations
and a brief overview of how each part works with your device.
Write a reflection on your experience, discussing the challenges
you faced, the skills you gained, and any ideas for future
improvements.
Deliverables:
The Customized Go Codebase: Submit your customized codebase
Documentation: Provide a document with details on your design and any
unique features you implemented.
Reflection: Include a short reflection on the assignment, discussing what you
learned and any challenges you overcame.
