Assignment: Customizing a Go API Codebase
Get familiar with the provided Go backend codebase and apply your understanding by
modifying the existing data entity, its handlers, validators, and database table.
Instructions
1. Explore the Codebase:
Identify the Handler, Service, Repository, and Model layers
based on the Handler - Service - Repository pattern.
Review how each layer interacts with the others, observing how
requests are processed and responses are generated starting
from main.go.
2. Modify the Data Entity:
apply your understanding of the codebase by modify the Data
entity in some way. For example add/remove fields, modify field
names. Do this according to your project needs.
3. Update Database Table:
Alter the database schema to match the new entity:
/api/cmd/production.db
The database can be removed or edited. If deleted a new empty
database will be generated at next startup.
4. Customize Handlers:
Modify (according to need) each handler to work with the new
entity, updating request parsing and response formatting based
on the new attributes.
5. Adjust Services and Validators:
Update (according to need) validation rules specific to the new
entity.
6. Authentication:
Change the username and password for the API. This is done in
the auth-middleware.

7. Testing:
Update unit tests for each modified layer to confirm that the new
entity and related functions work as expected.
Use go test to verify your changes.
Test API with modified entity and credentials.
Submit a short (3-4 pages) report containing the following:
What changes you made and why.
How each layer required modifications to accommodate the new entity.
Include screenshots!
